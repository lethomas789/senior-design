## Summary
We plan to host our site using Google’s App Engine and integrating Firebase as our database. Due to all of us being familiar with JavaScript, we decided to use Node/Express as our backend language, in which App Engine also supports. For our frontend framework, we decided to use React also due to our experience and interest in it. To minimize the complexity of payments, we are leaning towards using Paypal with an option for Venmo. 

## Server: Google App Engine
	
Pros:

- Server to store our code, host our site
- Connect to database hosted on Firebase
- Can host Node.js, store our code/files

Cons:

- SSL setup with custom domain name

## Database: Firebase (NoSQL)

Pros:

- Entire package
- Easy deployment server
- NoSQL - flexible data object storage
- JSON Storage
- Google Cloud Platform integration with Google App Engine
- Experience with NoSQL (MongoDB)

Cons:

- NoSQL: possibly limited database transactional capabilities
- Restricted to what Firebase can do

Reasons for Choosing: 

- Easy to integrate with our application being deployed onto Google App Engine. Experience using NoSQL databases as well. 

## Backend: Node/Express

Pros: 

- All familiar with JavaScript
- Developed using NPM libraries 
- Fullstack JS, frontend and backend in same JavaScript language
- Most comfortable backend language

Cons:

- Async troubles

Reasons for Choosing: 

- Our prior experience with Node/Express and wanting to have a consistent stack using all JavaScript. 

## Frontend: React

Pros:

- Virtual DOM, render only when components update
- Previous experience/familiarity
- Interested in practicing more with library

Cons:

- No defined methodologies among community for development
- Learn JSX

Reasons for Choosing: 

- Our prior experience with React and familiarity with JavaScript. Modern trends for development among companies use React, want to practice more with it. 


## Payment: Paypal 

Pros: 

- Easy to implement, minimize complexity
- Has Venmo option

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
